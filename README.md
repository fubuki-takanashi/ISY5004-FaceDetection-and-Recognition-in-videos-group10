# ISY5004-FaceDetection-and-Recognition-in-videos-group10

Facial recognition in videos is vital for applications in security, surveillance, and personalized services. 

This project aims to develop a robust system for real-time face detection and recognition in video streams. In this project, we trained and evaluated different face detection and face recognition algorithms using relevant benchmark datasets.**Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN)** for face detection and **InceptionResnetV1** for generating face embeddings for face recognition purpose are proved to have superior performance and contribute to high detection and recognition performance in the facial recognition system we developed. 

## Technologies Scope

- Python
- Pytorch
- Face Detection Networks(MTCNN, Yolov5, SSD, and Harr-Cascades)
- Feature Extraction Methods(Resnet V1, VGG-Face, FaceNet, and SEnet)
